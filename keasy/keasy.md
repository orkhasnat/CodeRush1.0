## Description

I am a fan of random numbers.
I encrypted the flag with a random key.
I then threw the key into the `/dev/null` blackhole.
Now I can't retrieve the flag.
But I heard your team specializes in retrieving keys from there.

Like Napoleon Once said:
`Give me the key. I shall give you the flag.`

This [file](keasy) has the encrypted flag in it. You can also use this file to decrypt the flag.

**flag format:** `coderush{fl4g}`

### Hint

The key does not necessarily have to be comprised of printable ascii characters.

***flag:***`coderush{ru5h_0f_n@p0l30n}`
